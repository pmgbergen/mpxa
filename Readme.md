# Multipoint flux discretizations

This repository provides an implementation of the multipoint flux approximation method in 
2d and 3d.
The core implementation is in C++, with python bindings provided for a limited set of the
functionality.
The primary motivation is to provide accelerated discretizations for 
[PorePy](https://github.com/pmgbergen/porepy), with suitable wrappers under implementation.

The software provided here, both the C++ code and Python wrappers, should be considered
immature and be used with some caution.
